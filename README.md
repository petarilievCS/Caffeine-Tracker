# Caffeine Up

iOS application that lets the user track their daily caffeine intake, the amount of caffeine in their metabolism and locate nearby coffee shops. The user can add their own custom drinks as well as track their intake and top drinks over the past week or past month. The application is developed in Swift, using the UIKit framework. The charts are implemented in SwiftUI, and the drinks data is stored using a CoreData database.
